== Upgrade Notice ==
1.0.0 Release
1.1.1 New Settings: "Comment Max Length Notification"

== Good to know ==

You can try to deactivate the options "Comment must be manually approved" and "Comment author must have a previously approved comment" in "Discussion Settings" and let the Plugin do the job for you.

By default, the plugin limits the comment text length to 1024 characters. Since the Content Moderator API can handle a maximum of 1024 characters per request. The limitation can be switched off in the plugin settings. Then, only the first 1024 chars of the comment will be checked.

Furthermore, all HTML tags are filtered out of the comment.
